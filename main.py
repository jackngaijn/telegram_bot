## Example Interactions
**Q:** What is your experience with machine learning?  
**A:** I have hands-on experience with machine learning techniques through my academic projects and work. For example, I developed a **Driver Behaviour Detection System** using **YOLO-v5**, which achieved 90% accuracy in identifying dangerous driving behaviors. Additionally, I worked on integrating machine learning techniques like **zero-shot classification** during my internship at the Census and Statistics Department.

**Q:** What advice would you give to someone pursuing a career in data science?  
**A:** To excel in data science, focus on building a strong foundation in programming languages like Python and SQL. Gain hands-on experience with machine learning frameworks, and work on projects to apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios. Competitions and internships, like the ones I participated in, are great ways to develop your skills and connect with industry professionals.

**Q:** Can you explain your research experience?  
**A:** Certainly! I worked as a Research Assistant at the Department of Information Technology at the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education. My research focused on developing an **Intelligent Driver Behaviour and Emotion Detection System** using **YOLO-v5** for real-time analysis. The project aimed to enhance road safety by identifying dangerous driving behaviors and emotional states.
